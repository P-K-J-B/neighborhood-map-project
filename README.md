# Neighborhood Map Project

Final project submission for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program. This app includes a list of Theatre venues in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom.

Use the search field to the left of the map screen to filter through the Cinemas and Theatres in the Leeds, inner-city area - either select a venue from the list or click on a marker in the map window to get the corresponding address details.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your machine by opening a terminal in a directory of your choice and entering the following command:

git clone https://github.com/P-K-J-B/neighborhood-map-project

cd into the neighborhood-map-project directory and run: npm install

### Viewing App in Developer Mode

After npm install has finished running, run: npm start

This will open a browser window at localhost:3000 (this will allow you to view the app in a live editing environment / developer mode)

### Viewing App in Production Mode

In order to see the app in production mode, you will have to run a build. While in the neighborhood-map-project directory run: 

npm run build

Then run the following command to serve the app on a static server:

serve -s build

Your terminal should now indicate what port the app is running on (http://localhost:5000 for example)

Open the corresponding localhost URL in your browser to view the production build of the application.

## Requirements

This app requires an internet browser with a working internet connection in order to function properly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
